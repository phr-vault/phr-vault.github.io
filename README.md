## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineer & Blockchain Health Systems Researcher with 7+ years of experience  
across Citi, PwC, and Siemens, specializing in:

- Web3 and blockchain-based healthcare systems  
- Personal Health Records (PHRs)  
- Decentralized identity & access control  
- Zero-trust security models  
- Digital health system architectures  
- Cloud-native full-stack development  

My PhD research developed a **blockchain-enabled Personal Health Record (PHR) system** with  
a strong focus on **patient-owned data**, **fine-grained access control**, **trust**, **security**,  
and **Web3-based governance** for healthcare.
