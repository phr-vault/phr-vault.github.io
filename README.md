🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Engineer & Blockchain Health Systems Researcher with 9+ years of experience
across Citi, PwC, and Siemens, building large-scale enterprise platforms and secure digital solutions.

My PhD research developed a blockchain-enabled Personal Health Record (PHR) system,
focused on:

- Patient-owned medical data
- Zero-trust access models
- Blockchain-based access control
- Web3 governance
- IPFS decentralized storage
- High-assurance healthcare data security

My work bridges software engineering, blockchain systems, cybersecurity,
and digital health innovation.

Why This Work Matters

• Blockchain-enabled PHR systems address critical U.S. healthcare challenges
• Fragmented medical records
• Poor interoperability
• Cybersecurity vulnerabilities
• Lack of transparent data access
• Limited patient control

This research contributes to:

- Modernizing national health IT infrastructure
- Improving patient autonomy & consent
- Reducing healthcare breach risks
- Strengthening U.S. cybersecurity resilence
- Advancing Web3-based digital health innovation

This aligns with U.S. priorities in digital health, cybersecurity,
and next-generation health information systems.
