# Abstract — PHR Vault (Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records)

PHR Vault is a decentralized Personal Health Record (PHR) system designed during Dr. Sumeet Bajaj’s PhD research (University of the Cumberlands). The system explores how blockchain technology can enhance patient trust, data security, privacy, and patient-centered control in digital health ecosystems.

The prototype uses Solidity smart contracts, decentralized file storage via IPFS, role-based access control, and zero-trust security principles. Findings from qualitative research indicate that blockchain-enabled PHRs can improve transparency, increase patient confidence in data handling, and reduce reliance on centralized intermediaries.

This project demonstrates a real-world blueprint for secure, patient-owned health data systems and forms the foundation for ongoing Web3 healthcare innovation, research publications, and future production-level architectures.
