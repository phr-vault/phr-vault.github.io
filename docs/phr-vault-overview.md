# PHR Vault — Technical & Functional Overview

PHR Vault is a blockchain-powered Personal Health Record system designed to provide patients with complete control over their medical data using decentralized technologies.

---

## 🔍 Purpose
Traditional PHR systems rely on centralized databases that introduce vulnerabilities, access limitations, and lack transparency. PHR Vault addresses these issues by offering:

- Patient-owned data access  
- Transparent permissions  
- Immutable audit trails  
- Secure decentralized storage  

---

## 🧱 System Architecture (High-Level)
PHR Vault follows five core layers:

1. **Client Layer**  
   - React/Next.js front-end  
   - Connect wallet, manage records, share permissions  

2. **Smart Contract Layer**  
   - Solidity contracts for data access control  
   - Role-based permissions  
   - Event logging for audits  

3. **Decentralized Storage Layer**  
   - IPFS for secure document storage  
   - Content addressing for integrity  

4. **Identity & Access Layer**  
   - Public/private key ownership  
   - Zero-trust authentication model  

5. **Off-Chain Metadata Layer**  
   - Record indexing  
   - UX and performance improvements

## 🛡️ Security Features
- Zero-trust security  
- Immutable on-chain access events  
- Role-based permission architecture  
- Patient-centered data control  
- Encrypted IPFS storage

## 🧪 Research Foundation
PHR Vault was developed as part of Dr. Sumeet Bajaj’s doctoral research:

> *“Patient Perceptions of Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records (2025)”*

The research demonstrated strong patient interest in:

- Transparency  
- Control over medical data  
- System efficiency  
- Strong privacy features
