**Oriented summary**

This blockchain-based study investigates how patients perceive **security, privacy, trust, efficiency, and usability** when their Personal Health Records (PHRs) are managed on a Web3 infrastructure. Using in-depth qualitative interviews, the work:

- Identifies **patient trust drivers and concerns** around immutability, audit trails, and cryptographic security.  
- Examines how **perceived security and control over data** influence willingness to adopt blockchain-based PHR systems.  
- Highlights **design and policy recommendations** for patient-centric data access, consent, and transparency in digital health.

The results are directly relevant to **national interests in healthcare data security, patient safety, and modernization of health IT infrastructure**, especially as health systems explore Web3 and decentralized models.

**NIW / O-1 oriented summary**

This paper presents a **systematic review** of blockchain-enabled PHR architectures published between 2017–2025, synthesizing work across **security, adoption, governance, and patient-centered design**. The review:

- Maps existing **technical architectures** (on-chain/off-chain storage, smart contracts, access-control models, and audit mechanisms).  
- Evaluates how current systems address **core security requirements** (confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation).  
- Analyzes **adoption barriers** such as interoperability, user experience, regulatory alignment (HIPAA/GDPR-style concerns), and scalability.  
- Proposes a **patient-centered reference model** for blockchain PHRs that balances decentralization with clinical usability and policy compliance.

This work positions Dr. Bajaj as an expert at the intersection of **blockchain, cybersecurity, and healthcare informatics**, and provides a foundational reference for organizations and governments considering **national-scale digital health and data-security modernization**.
